Issue Summary:
Duration: July 10th, 2023, 14:00 - July 11th, 2023, 02:30 (UTC)
Impact: Slow response and intermittent outages on the User Authentication Service, affecting 15% of users.

Root Cause: A misconfigured load balancer caused degraded performance and intermittent outages in the User Authentication Service.

Timeline:

    July 10th, 14:00 (UTC): Issue Detected
    July 10th, 14:10 (UTC): Monitoring alert triggered due to increased response times.
    July 10th, 14:15 (UTC): Engineering team initiated investigation.
    July 10th, 14:30 (UTC): Assumed initial root cause to be database connectivity issues.
    July 10th, 15:00 (UTC): Further investigation revealed load balancer misconfiguration affecting routing.
    July 10th, 15:15 (UTC): Misleading assumption made that backend services were at fault.
    July 10th, 16:00 (UTC): Incident escalated to Network Operations team for load balancer inspection.
    July 10th, 18:30 (UTC): Load balancer's faulty configuration identified.
    July 10th, 19:00 (UTC): Configuration changes rolled back, restoring some service stability.
    July 11th, 02:30 (UTC): Root cause fully addressed, User Authentication Service performance restored.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause was traced to a load balancer misconfiguration, causing uneven distribution of traffic among backend servers. This resulted in some servers being overloaded while others were underutilized, leading to slow response times and intermittent outages.

To resolve the issue, the Network Operations team corrected the load balancer configuration and redistributed traffic evenly. Additionally, they implemented monitoring to promptly detect and address any future misconfigurations.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Conduct a thorough audit of load balancer configurations to ensure proper setup and monitoring.
    Implement automated monitoring to detect load balancer anomalies and misconfigurations in real-time.
    Schedule regular load testing to simulate traffic spikes and ensure proper distribution among backend servers.
    Establish clear communication channels between engineering teams for rapid incident response and resolution.
    Develop a playbook detailing load balancer configurations and troubleshooting steps for future incidents.

By addressing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to prevent future occurrences of similar issues, minimize service disruptions, and enhance the overall reliability of our systems.

We value the lessons learned from this incident and remain committed to maintaining a high standard of service for our users. Your trust is of utmost importance to us, and we will continue to invest in the improvement of our infrastructure and processes.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support as we strive to deliver an exceptional experience for all our users.
